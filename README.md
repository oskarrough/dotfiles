A collection of my dotfiles.

I clone this repository to my computers to set them up as I prefer.

If you like, remember to set up symlinks between the cloned repo and actual dotfiles. See `install.sh`.

1. `git clone git@github.com:oskarrough/dotfiles.git ~/Dropbox/Apps/dotfiles`
2. `cd ~/Dropbox/Apps/dotfiles`
3. `./install.sh`

I develop primarily on OSX, Fedora and Windows + WSL. I use the fish shell, neovim, homebrew, linuxbrew and i3wm.
