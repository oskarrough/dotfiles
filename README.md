A collection of my dotfiles.

I clone this repository to my computers and can run the install script to symlink them to the actual files in their correct locations on the system.

1. `git clone git@github.com:oskarrough/dotfiles.git ~/Dropbox/Apps/dotfiles`
2. `cd ~/Dropbox/Apps/dotfiles`
3. `./install.sh`

I develop on Fedora and OSX, I use the fish shell, home- and linuxbrew, i3wm, neovim.
